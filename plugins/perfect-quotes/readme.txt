= Shortcode =

From any page or post, you can add shortcode to display all your quotes. There are now two ways of accomplishing this:

* The New Way: From the editor window, click on the Perfect Quotes icon next to the "Upload/Insert" media icon. A simple popup will help you select which quote you want to display and enter the shortcode for you! It's that easy!
* The Old Way: From the Perfect Quotes home area, there is a column called Shortcode. Find the particular quote you want and copy the corresponding shortcode. It looks something like [perfect_quotes id="1"]. Paste this into your post or onto a page and your quote will magically appear!
